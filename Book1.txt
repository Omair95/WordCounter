You need to find the word frequency of every word inside the text of all the books in a library (i.e. for each word, a word count). 
You can assume that the text for each book will be inside a single file in English, ASCII format  using Latin alphabet, and that 
it will be formatted with line breaks for each line end/ page end (Linux format). For simplicity, we’ll assume that any whitespace 
is the word delimiter, and we won’t consider punctuation. (e.g. “don’t” is the same as “dont”). There will be a single fille called 
“index.txt” that contains the list of file names to process. There are no page numbers etc. Just pure text. You must utilize as many
 cores of the CPU as possible, let’s say for this example that the CPU has 16 cores. The process will collect the word statistics in 
 memory as it processes the files. You will process 1 file per core at a time. You can output to console, or file. You will use a 
 single in memory object to collate the statistics as the counting happens Realtime. You will print the top 500 words at the end.
